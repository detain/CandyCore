# P11 batch-2 §5 re-check (five files)

Base at re-check time: `master = 6aa5dc30e` (batch-1 staffing landed as this commit;
batch-1 doc merges paused on an unrelated identity repair — NOT waited on, NOT merged).
Baseline gate for `--full-history`: `3e053e3c9` (prompt-resume: Phase 10 closed + FOLD-1).
Method per file: `git log --oneline -3 -- <path>`; classify last-touch prompt-lane vs
foreign by subject P-token; where a subject lacks a token, topology decides via
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> 447541d7e`. Subject is advisory; topology decides.

## Per-file last-touch

| file | last-touch | P-token? | verdict |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| `sugar-crush/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | `da178befb` "P7.S6 fix-cycle-2: importer docblocks told the truth post-wiring; ARCHITECTURE/MEMORY/Bootstrap prose; nit batch" | YES (P7.S6) | prompt-lane |
| `sugar-crush/docs/PROMPT_ENGINEERING.md` | — (file absent on disk; empty `git log`) | new file | prompt-lane (net-new) |
| `sugar-crush/src/Context/MemoryBlock.php` | `e9b3d204a` "P5.S3: route `<project-memory>` and `<repo-map>` bodies through PromptFence" | YES (P5.S3) | prompt-lane |
| `sugar-crush/tests/Integration/PromptEndToEndTest.php` | — (file absent on disk; empty `git log`) | new file | prompt-lane (net-new) |
| `sugar-crush/tests/Integration/SystemPromptWiringTest.php` | `129587a97` "sugar-crush: P7.S3 cycle-2 review nits - derive the seam figure, write config through production, make the pins bite" | YES (P7.S3) | prompt-lane |

All three last-touch shas confirmed ancestors of master (`merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> master` → OK).
The two net-new files have no history to classify.

## Required range confirmation (authoritative — path-filtered)

```
git log --oneline --full-history 3e053e3c9..master \
  -- sugar-crush/src/Context/MemoryBlock.php sugar-crush/tests/Integration/
```

Returns ZERO commits. No commit in `3e053e3c9..master` touches `MemoryBlock.php` or any
file under `tests/Integration/`. Therefore "only prompt-lane or zero" is satisfied (zero).

## Corroboration — the whole post-baseline range is prompt-lane

`3e053e3c9..master` = 11 commits, every subject a prompt-lane token or prompt-kit/plan/
worklog/resume/staffing housekeeping:

```
6aa5dc30e prompt/P11 batch-1 staffing ...        08f6cbb22 Merge branch 'prompt/P24' ...

```

No foreign (crush_code / non-prompt) subject touches any batch-2 path.

## Crush-lane standing instruction (quoted, worktrees NOT read)

From `docs/plans/crush_code_RESUME.md:24-27`:

> **The decision on record is: run `prompt_plan.md` to completion FIRST, then come back for round 61.**
> Round 60 cleared the two crush_code items that blocked it (§2.6 of `prompt_plan.md`, rows 1 and 5).
> While that plan runs, **launch no crush_code round** — rows 2 and 7 of its interference table are
> free only because no round is in flight, and they re-block the instant one is.

No crush_code round is in flight; the prompt lane owns the tree for batch 2.

## VERDICT: CLEAN — no foreign touch found. Proceed to staffing.
